     <h3><!--<i class="fas fa-feather-alt"></i>--> Origin Story</h3>

    <p class="left indent">Once upon a time ...
      in the undiscovered faraway land full of mythical creatures and magics noone has ever seen,
      a brave adventurous young bunny with the fluffiest tail and cheeks named Claire was hopping
      around expansive green hills filled with the sweetest smell of blossomed wild honey flowers
      along with her dearest friends — Stella and Penelope. Stella is a young rainbow unicorn with
      the most beautiful wings who exels in astronomy and science. Penelope, who aces in
      Mathematics and Physical activities, is a beloved daughter and an heiress to throne of the
      most revered lion king in the Wilderness, Phillip Lion IV.</p>

    <p class="left indent">In their next final magic class, they are going to be facing the most challenging
      and difficult exam of the Mythic Land — to collect 7 rare magical ingredients for their
      ancient magic class with Professor Arthurvigne von Dubois within 7 days. To pass this test,
      Claire and her friends need to prioritize and work on all of the assigned tasks within a
      given limited time. So in order to pass all of the obstacles they are going to be
      facing, they need a special magical tool — <span class="highlight">A Magical ToDo List</span>
      — to enable them to follow through their progress and keep track of any completed,
      in-progress or new assigments from the Professor. However, this magical tool has disappeared
      for over 100 bunllion years.</p>

    <img class="mb-4 bunny-img" src="images/bunny.gif" alt="bunny pic">
    <p class="left indent">One night, while Claire was singing a bunny-lullaby which was sung for her every night by
      her much loved mother under the full moonlight near the crystal well at
      the Sunrise river, an unexpected Lunar eclipse happened hiding the moon and all its soft
      light behind the darkness. Then suddenly Claire's family ring shined up brightly at the
      crystal well allowing Claire to see the Magical ToDo List tool slowly floating up to the
      air. Claire then reached her hands to grap it and immediately realized that she just
      discovered the long lost ancient magical tool that could never be found for bunllions of
      years. Happily, knowing that her family's ring and the bunny-lullaby passed by generations
      of the McBunny family was the key to find thr ancient trasure.</p>

    <p class="left indent">Claire was jumping and hopping around the crystal well with happiness thinking to herself
      that now she and her dearest friends could easily pass the toughest exam of the Mythic Land
      with this magic tool. On top, she could use this Magical ToDo List to tackle all of the
      upcoming challenges gathering on her way for her future or other responsibilities.
      The only last things that Claire and her friends had to do is to collect all of the rare
      magical ingredients and don't forget to use this ToDo List tool while on the quests.
      Let's the adventure begin!</p>
